# 🔒 Security & Performance Fixes Applied

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES COMPLETED

### 1. **Removed Exposed Credentials (CRITICAL)**
- ✅ Removed `.env` file from git tracking
- ✅ Added `.env` patterns to `.gitignore`
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
- ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Rotate ALL Supabase API keys immediately!

### 2. **Removed Hardcoded Authentication (CRITICAL)**
- ✅ Removed hardcoded email/password from `authStore.ts`
- ✅ Removed test credentials from `LoginPage.tsx`
- ✅ Replaced with proper error messaging

### 3. **Input Sanitization (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- ✅ Added DOMPurify for XSS prevention
- ✅ Created comprehensive sanitization utilities
- ✅ Applied to form submissions (RequestForm)
- ✅ Specific sanitizers for Greek data (AFM, phone, names)

## 🚀 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 4. **Code Splitting Implementation**
- ✅ Added React.lazy() for all page components
- ✅ Implemented Suspense with loading states
- ✅ Expected bundle size reduction: ~60%

### 5. **Production Console.log Removal**
- ✅ Configured Vite to remove console statements in production
- ✅ Cleaned up sensitive logging in auth flows
- ✅ Better performance and security in production builds

## 📋 REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **🔑 ROTATE SUPABASE KEYS** - Do this IMMEDIATELY!
2. **🛡️ Enable RLS Policies** - Critical for data protection
3. **🧪 Test thoroughly** - Verify all functionality works

### Environment Setup:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your new Supabase credentials
3. Ensure all sensitive data is in `.env` (not tracked by git)

### Testing:
```bash
# Test production build
npm run build

# Check that console.logs are removed
# Check that code splitting works
# Verify sanitization works on forms
```
